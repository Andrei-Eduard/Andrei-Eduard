    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Duku - The Totally Unreliable Search Engine</h3>
    <p>
	With our 2-week-long coding bootcamp coming to an end, each one of us had to come up and realise a project of our own.<br><br> Although my project might contain countless flaws, logical errors, and hard-coded structures, I also believe that this project is of a significant value, since it is a clear mirror of what I have been capable of creating in the given conditions. This project truly highlighted what I lack in and it has definitely helped me in getting better at programming.<br><br>
    My project consisted of a parody to Google, the biggest, most advanced used web search engine for the last two or three decades. Unlike the actual search engine, my version, by design, will not give you what you search for, and instead:
        <ul><li>Will provide you with various errors, leaving you with no choice but to quit the "web browser"</li>
      <li>Will provide you with wrong search results</li>
      <li>Will probably "shut down" you computer by accident</li></ul>
    <br><br>
    Aside from the "main functionality", our project also attempted to simulate (more or less) the Windows GUI and a the lucky spinning wheel found on the Google Search Engine.
    </p>

      Within the project, an advanced usage of various types of variables, control structures, methods, libraries and custom classes can be found, along with various errors, bad naming policies and unreadable code.
